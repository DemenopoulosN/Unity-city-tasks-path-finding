# Unity-city-tasks-path-finding

In this project, a 2D world was created based on a grid system. In this world, agents are deployed in order to complete a number of tasks as their plan suggests. A goal is to move on a shortest path, thus a search algorithm was implemented based on the Wavefront Expansion Algorithm and the BFS.
